**iso-week-date** is a toolkit to work with strings representing [ISO Week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) in two formats, namely:

- Week format **YYYY-WNN** (date format **%Y-W%V**)
- Week date format **YYYY-WNN-D** (date format **%Y-W%V-%u**)

where _YYYY_ represents the year, _W_ is a string literal, _NN_ represents the week number, and _D_ represents the day of the week.

In a nutshell it provides:

- [`IsoWeek`](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/api/isoweek/) and [`IsoWeekDate`](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/api/isoweekdate/) classes that implement a series of methods to work with ISO Week (Date) formats directly, avoiding the pitfalls of going back and forth between string, date and datetime python objects.
- [pandas](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/api/pandas/) and [polars](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/api/polars/) functionalities (and namespaces) to work with series of ISO Week dates.
- [pydantic](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/user-guide/pydantic/) compatible types, as described in their docs section on how to [customize validation with `__get_pydantic_core_schema__`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/types/#customizing-validation-with-__get_pydantic_core_schema__)
